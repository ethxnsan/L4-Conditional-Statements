## Conditional Statements
Used for decision-making operations based on the condition.

## Condition 
An expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value (T/F) 

```python
if(CONDITION):
  BODY STATEMENT

else:
  BODY STATEMENT
```
 python relies on indentation to define scope

 ### Elif

 `elif allows us to add more than one condition to our `if` blocks

 Conditional statements always start with an `if` header, `elif` is optional, but we can have as many as we want. `else` is also optional, but we can only have 1 `else` for every `if` 

 Ex.
```python
month = 2
if(month == 1):
  print("January")
elif (month == 2)
  print("February")
elif (month == 3)
  print("March")
elif (month == 4)
  print("April")
else:
  print("The month is between May and December")  
```
